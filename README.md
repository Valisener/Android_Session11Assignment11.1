# Android_Session11Assignment11.1


A It is designed to manage the database creation and version management, It takes care of opening the database if it finds one, if not it creates the database, upgrades the database when it is needed. Helps maintain the database as well over all a very useful class for database usage.


b. is for changing the database, adding new columns ect... adding constraints. The users that use an old version with the old version in the database releasing a new database version will automatically get the old users running the new database to avoid problems. This way they can upgrade the database without having to delete the entire database and lose the information they had and recreate it otherwise it would be very troublesome to keep having to delete the database and losing all the things in the database.
